This is a simple spike on using the R package shiny to create a simple ClearStats
web app.

To run it simply do:

  chmod +x run.sh
  ./run.sh

where the first command is optional once you've made sure the run.sh file is
executable. After installing any missing R packages the shiny web app starts up
and you can point your browser to the url it prints on stdout.
